<!-- Explanation on How to Calculate Gold Rate -->
<div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 py-8">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-800 mb-6">How do you calculate gold rate?</h1>
    
    <!-- Main explanation -->
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        To calculate the gold rate, you need to know the current spot price and gold purity. The spot price of gold is the current price of gold per gram on the open market.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Gold purity explanation -->
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Gold purity is measured in karats - 24 karat gold is 100% pure gold, 18 karat gold is 75% pure gold, 14 karat gold is 58.3% pure gold, and ten karat gold is 41.7% pure gold. To calculate the gold rate:
    </p>
    
    <!-- Formula -->
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed italic">
        Final price of (22 or 18 K) gold multiplied by the weight in grams + making charges + GST on the price of jewellery + making charges
    </p>
    
    <!-- Example Calculation -->
    <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-md space-y-3 mb-6">
        <p class="text-gray-600">
            If the gold rate today for 10 grams of <span class="text-pink-500">22 karats of pure gold</span> is INR 50,000:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-600">
            <li>• The price of 1 gram of gold is INR 5,000.</li>
            <li>• If you want gold jewellery that weighs 8 grams, The price is 5000 × 8 = INR 40,000.</li>
            <li>• If the making charges are 10% of the gold price, it is INR 4000.</li>
            <li>• The total price becomes INR 40,000 + 4000 = INR 44,000</li>
            <li>• Now add 3% of GST on gold, i.e., 3% of 44,000 = 1,320</li>
            <li>• Final price is 44000 + 1,320 = INR 45,320</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Disclaimer/Note -->
    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm italic">
        There are no making charges or wastage included in this estimate, which are determined by the product's craftsmanship.

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center mb-6 text-purple-800">Why Does Gold's Price Fluctuate? - The Top 10 Factors</h1>
    
    <div class="space-y-4">
        <!-- Each Factor -->
        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">1. Inflation</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Rising inflation diminishes the purchasing power of money, making gold more attractive as a hedge against inflation. This increased demand can lead to higher gold prices.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">2. Jewellery Associations</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Organizations like the Indian Bullion Jewellers Association influence gold pricing. Regional associations, such as the Jewellers and Diamond Traders Association in Tamil Nadu, help set gold prices within specific cities.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">3. Purchase Price</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">The purchase price of gold significantly affects its retail price. Jewelers who acquire gold at lower costs can offer more competitive prices, while the source of gold also plays a role in pricing.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">4. Central Bank Actions</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Central banks hold substantial gold reserves and can impact prices through their buying and selling activities. When they purchase gold, demand increases, typically driving prices up. Conversely, selling can lead to lower prices.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">5. Currency Fluctuation</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">The strength of a currency influences gold prices in India. A strong local currency can make gold cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially boosting demand and prices.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">6. Quantity of Gold</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Regional demand varies across India, with South India accounting for nearly 40% of gold imports. Areas with higher demand can see corresponding increases in gold prices.</p>

        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">7. Seasonal Demand in India</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Festive seasons, weddings, and special occasions lead to spikes in gold purchases, affecting overall demand and subsequently driving up prices during these periods.</p>

        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">8. Market Conditions</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Global market trends impact domestic gold rates. When gold prices rise internationally, it often correlates with increases in local prices.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">9. Production Costs</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">The operational costs of mining can affect gold pricing. If production expenses rise, it may lead to higher prices as supply adjusts to meet costs.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white">
            <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">10. Transport Costs</h2>

        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">How Does GST Apply to Gold?</h1>
        <p class="mb-6">
            The Goods and Services Tax (GST) affects gold in several ways, both directly and indirectly, depending on the form of gold and the purpose of purchase. Here's a breakdown:

            <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded shadow">
                <h3 class="font-semibold">Direct impact:</h3>
                <h5>GST on gold purchase:</h5>
                <p>A flat 3% GST is levied on the gold value itself, whether it's in the form of bars, coins, or jewellery. This is considered lower than most other goods and services.
                    <br><br>Making charges: For jewellery, an additional 5% GST is charged on the making charges separately.
                    <br><br>Impact on price: Overall, the price of gold has increased slightly due to the combined effect of both 3% and 5% GST.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded shadow">
                <h3 class="font-semibold">Indirect impact:</h3>
                <p>Import duty: Imported gold bears a 10% customs duty in addition to the 3% GST. This has made importing gold more expensive, impacting some segments of the industry.
                    <br><br>Formalisation of trade: GST has brought the gold industry under a more formal tax regime, potentially reducing tax evasion and black market activity. However, this might have also impacted some small informal players.

        <p class="mb-4">
            We know there has been a resurgence in the popularity of vintage and antique jewellery. The latest jewellery trend is for unique pieces with a history. Antique or heirloom jewellery is having a moment. Another hot trend is lightweight jewellery. Let's start with jewellery with history.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Heirloom or Antique Jewellery</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">

These heirloom pieces are not just accessories; they're a slice of personal history, brimming with character and charm.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Antique jewellery invites you to blend different eras and styles, creating a look that's uniquely yours. Consider combining the elegance of Antique Sun Diamond Stud Earrings in 18 K white gold with the charm of an Antique Sun Diamond Pendant for a classic yet contemporary vintage vibe.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Whether you're looking for a unique piece of jewellery for yourself or a special gift for someone else, antique jewellery is a beautiful option.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Lightweight Jewellery</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The jewellery world is constantly evolving, and new trends are always emerging. As much as antique jewellery is trending, so is lightweight jewellery.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Lightweight Earrings</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            You can choose stud or drop earrings. For example, Hover Butterfly Diamond Stud Earrings would be a good choice for the office and an evening out. If you like wearing drop earrings, the Rhodeus Drop Gold Earrings or the Twinkling Circlet Diamond Drop Earrings will go well with any outfit.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Physical gold has been used as a form of currency, jewellery, and other decorative items for centuries. Supply and demand must be factored in to determine the value of gold. When the demand for gold is high, the price of gold will increase.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            The reverse is also true; when the demand for gold is low, the price of gold will decrease. Gold investment is typically seen as safe, especially during times of economic uncertainty. This is because gold is not affected by the same economic factors that can cause the value of other investments, such as stocks and bonds, to fluctuate.
        </p>

            For this reason, many investors choose to invest in gold in a volatile stock market. According to market studies and future predictions on gold rates, the price is expected to increase.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Different people have different preferences when it comes to gold jewellery, and these preferences can change over time. Ultimately, the individual decides what gold is best for them. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
            Generally, 24-karat gold is too soft to be made into jewellery. Some people opt for 22-karat gold, while others prefer 18-karat or 14-karat options. The lower the karat, the less gold content it has and the more it is alloyed with other metals, which can impact both the colour and durability of the gold.

            <li>
                <strong>22 Karat Gold:</strong> A popular choice that balances purity and durability, ideal for fine jewellery.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>18 Karat Gold:</strong> Contains 75% gold and is durable enough for daily wear, making it a great option for rings and bracelets.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>14 Karat Gold:</strong> Contains 58.3% gold and is more affordable and durable, suitable for everyday jewellery.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>White Gold:</strong> An alloy of gold and silver or palladium, white gold has a bright white colour and is often used in pieces designed to resemble platinum or silver.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rose Gold:</strong> An alloy of gold and copper, rose gold features a pinkish hue and is popular in vintage or antique-style jewellery.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Gold-Plated Jewellery:</strong> A cost-effective alternative made by bonding a thin layer of gold to a base metal. However, it can wear away over time and lacks the value of solid gold.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-4">
            When choosing gold jewellery, consider both purity and durability. Generally, 18 karat or 14 karat gold is recommended for a good balance of quality and wearability.

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 mt-4">
            <li>
                <strong>Gold Testing Kit:</strong> 
                A popular method involves using a gold testing kit that contains different acids. Scratch a small amount of your gold onto a testing stone and apply a drop of the acid. If the acid changes color, it indicates that your gold is not pure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Magnifying Glass:</strong> 
                Use a magnifying glass to inspect your gold closely. Look for any dark spots or streaks; their presence suggests that the gold may not be pure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Professional Testing:</strong> 
                For the most accurate results, consider taking your gold to a professional jeweler or assay office. While this method may be more expensive, it ensures precise testing of your gold's purity.
            </li>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Buying gold is a significant part of our culture and is considered one of the safer investments. Once your gold has reached your hands, ensuring its security is essential. Here are some steps to keep your gold safe and secure:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 mt-4">
            <li>
                <strong>Get a Home Safe:</strong> Investing in a home safe is one of the best ways to keep your gold secure. A robust safe is tough to break into and will deter potential thieves.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use a Safety Deposit Box:</strong> If you don’t have a home safe, consider storing your gold in a safety deposit box at the bank. This is a secure option for safeguarding your assets.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Choose a Safe Location at Home:</strong> If you prefer keeping your gold at home, store it in a locked drawer or closet. Ensure that the location is not obvious to others.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Insure Your Gold:</strong> Obtaining gold insurance protects your investment against fire, natural disasters, theft, or loss, providing peace of mind.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Invest in Digi Gold:</strong> Digi Gold offers a modern approach to buying and storing gold digitally. It eliminates the risks associated with physical storage and allows easy access to your investment through online platforms.
